Do you remember
All the nights that we were forced
To sit cross legged and listen to jazz?
It began in September
Overbites and acne followed suit for every geek and every spazz

It's ringing bells, now
I remember Safety Girl
She had a house on Fantasy Lane
That shit is cinch now
Give it up for Safety Girl
She had a face and she had a name

Now I've got a diploma
My work is passing muster
And my memories of her slowly fade
Such a strange aroma
Hints of Dijon mustard and mayonnaise derived from lemonade

This premonition comes as no surprise to Safety Girl
It won't be long before it all comes true
The parasite that lives inside of Safety Girl
Someday will live inside me and you

Remember Safety Girl
Remember her so well
Remember Safety Girl
Remember her (her, her, her, her, her)

What really matters are the memories of Safety Girl
I used to hang on each and every word
But there are some hazards when you give yourself to Safety Girl
The line between safe and sorry is blurred

My word
My word
My word
Safety Girl's a different kind of bird

My word
My word
Safety Girl's a different kind of bird
