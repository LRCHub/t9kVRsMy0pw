I looked up in the sun
And I didn't shake my eyes
Then a girl appeared and said
"Here, these are your size"

Suzie safety
Suzie safety
Suzie safety

I tried to cross the street
And I almost got mowed down
But the softest little hand
Yanked me back to safer ground

Suzie safety
Suzie safety
Suzie safety

She says, no smoking
She says, no drink
You should wear a parka
I'm really safe but I kind of resent

Suzie safety
Suzie safety
Suzie safety

When she's near to me
And there's no one else around
And I can't control myself
She says, "Safety first, pal"

Suzie safety
Suzie safety
Suzie safety

She says no speeding
And always eat right
Watch your fats and starches
I'm really safe but I kind of resent

Suzie safety
Suzie safety
Suzie safety

She's safe in my arms
And I'm safe in hers

Suzie safety
Suzie safety
Suzie safety

Suzie safety
Suzie safety
Suzie safety

Suzie safety
Suzie safety
Suzie safety
