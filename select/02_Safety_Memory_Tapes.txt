There is a sound, waving me down
It s like the voice of forever ground
Something has changed me, and it s strange
I don t know where you are, what you want
Follow it down, throw me around
Remember back in the place where we ve start
Something has changed, feeling strange
I think I barely know who you are
Carry on, sounding, we know where you ve been
And you re always gone, I can tell that you re one
The thing that you re holding on
Don t cry, this time, remember what you ve said
And you re holding it all, when you don t wanna talk
And you take it back when you can
I wanna cut you up, save some part of you
Giving it back to me

When you always want, I can tell you ... holding on
Alright, we never could decide
We never should have tried
Plus if necessary
Be a long way ...
Oh, alright, this is your chance to cry
Be on my way, ...be the last time
I wanna cut you up, save some part of you
Giving it back to me
Back, back, back, back, back
When you always want, I can tell you ... holding on
Need one time,
I will never, I will never ... me
The city you can see, all the time
When we re beside, we re beside
I will never, I will never ... me
The city you can see, all the time
When we re beside, we re beside.
